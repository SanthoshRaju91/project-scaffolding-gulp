# Project Scaffolding

This is the project scaffolding for angular project, which is integrated with Gulp.js for both development and production build.

In devleopment, there is a browser-sync task for updating the view on the browser while we develop.

In production, all the *.js & *.css and images files are concatenated, minified and built as a production ready application.
